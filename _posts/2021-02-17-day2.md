## creating the habitat 
The slugs are now in my home. They seem to be alive, but not very active. I don't think they're too happy in their tiny sugared-green-tea-smelling environment. Summary from research done on the most ideal slug habitat: 
  
  * needs to be slightly damp all of the time 
  * food source (leaves)
  * some twigs for exercise
  * shelter 
  
 
### **Draft 1.1**

Slug appears to enjoy oats. 

## slug-habitat (room) for improvement 
* Better air circulation (possibly upgrade the space and put in a real plant?)/poke more holes in the lid of the box 
* More areas for the slugs to hide (especially for glug, the big slug). If the slugs survive for more than a month, consider upgrading to a two-layered habitat. 
* Find larger leaves (for better hiding places) 
* Find a way to measure humidity within the box, and install appropriate devices that can help to control the humidity levels in the box when it falls below a certain level.
